5.it is transferring to .class file
6.loading to the memory while running
7.to provide description we can use java.comments
8.Annotation can become member of java file like interface enum 
9.while compiling .class file generating to annotation also
10.by default annotation are 100% abstract 
11.Annotation are  not for any logic
12.it can not proccessing logic is printed to Annotation its only for providing description
13.Annotation are develop 2 @ interface
14.inside Annotation we can develop only method declaration


->Annotation can become a member of the java file
->while compiling .class file is generating also
->while using annottion we can provide description 
->annotation should contain only method declaration with a specific return type value
->compiling we get o/p only we not get any annotation declartion
