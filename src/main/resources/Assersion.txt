--Assersion--
->Assersion are introduced in jdk1.4
->assert is the keyword from jdk1.4
->Assersions are used for rising AssersionError whenever buissness condition is failing for a particular group of users
->It is vey similar to throw keyword
->in Exception handling we have seen throw keyword usage
	same functionality is used with little changes

there are 2 type of assert statement available
1.VSA
-------
assert boolean_result;

2.SA
-------
assert boolean_result : some_msg;

by default both the assret statements are not executing 
in order to exceute assert statements explicitly we have to supply VM (Virtual Machine) argument
-ea	(or)	-enableassertions
we can disable assertions explicitly by another VM arg
-da	(or)	-disableassertions

enableling or disasbleing assertions are in 3 different places
1.Execution wise
	-ea
	-da

2.Package wise
	-ea:package_name...
	-da:package_name...

3.Class wise
	-ea:com.lara.Manager
	-da:com.lara.Manager
 
 we can specify any class name in case of throw but we can not rise any class name
 throw keyword always last statement in the current block
 but assert is assign anywhere in the class
