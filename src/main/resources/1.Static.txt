A class in Java can contain:

1.fields
2.methods
3.constructors
4.blocks
5.nested class and interface

**when class is created every static members are loaded in the memory**

Object Definitions:

new keyword in Java-
The new keyword is used to allocate memory at run time.
All objects get memory in Heap memory area.**

**object can be created in any method
the total memory can b divided into two parts:
stack and heap**
heap memory is for storing purpose
objects are created in the heap memory and
references are created in the stack memory.

one object can have any number of reference variable.
same object can be referred by multiple reference variable.

**when object is created every non-static members are loaded in the memory**

default reference variable available with a non static .

----STATIC----

static member can be used anywhere in the class

non static member can not be used inside static method

static members are loading to the memory at the time of class loading***

we can not use any non static member in the main method straight away.
