In any programming language 2 types of thread are providing
1.User Thread
2.Daemon Thread

1.User Thread
It is not depending on its parent
executing without considering its parent
no matter parent is under execution or not

2.Daemon Thread
always depending on parent
whenever parent is leaving it is also leaving
without worrying about its execution

whenever running java command 3 threads are creating

2.Garbage Collector

->Garbage Collector and main both are registering in the Thread Scheduler
